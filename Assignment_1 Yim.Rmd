# 1. Download dataset from the web
# I downloaded the data from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashadferguson/college-sports-attendance?select=Attendance.xlsx 
# There were categorial variables: University, Conference, Sport, Season. Also there were quantitative variables: Home_Games, Total_Attendance, Average_Attendance. I read the data as below.

```{r}
attendance <- read.csv("C:/Users/hyim/OneDrive - Kent State University/Desktop/New folder/attendance.csv")
```

```{r}
# Quick peek at data
head(attendance)
```


# 2. Descriptive statistics
# Quantitative variable summaries
```{r}
summary(attendance$Home_Games)
summary(attendance$Total_Attendance)
summary(attendance$Average_Attendance)
```
# Categorical variables
```{r}
table(attendance$Conference)
table(attendance$Sport)
```

# 3. Transform a variable
# I transformed the attendance per game variable to attendance per game in thousands

```{r}
attendance$Avg_Attendance_K <- attendance$Average_Attendance / 1000
```

# 4. Plot quantitative variable
```{r}
hist(attendance$Total_Attendance,
     main = "Histogram of Total Attendance",
     xlab = "Total Attendance",
     col = "lightblue")
```
# 5. Scatterplot: Home Games vs Total Attendance
```{r}
plot(attendance$Home_Games, attendance$Total_Attendance,
     xlab = "Home Games",
     ylab = "Total Attendance",
     main = "Home Games vs Total Attendance",
     col = "darkred", pch = 19)
```
